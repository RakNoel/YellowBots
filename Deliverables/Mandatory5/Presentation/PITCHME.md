### Learning by doing

Note:
- First of using tools
    - Git / Github
    - Codacy
- Importance of 
    - code reviews
    - Documentation
    - Build and "deploy"
    - Integration and Unit testing
- Work better as a group
- Too many disconnected tools is bad
- LISTEN to your TOOLS
    - They're probably right
    - You're probably not
- Don't rush it
    - Even if it's super fun
- You cant get to mars without at-least one spaceship
    - But do you really need to get there?

### What would we change?
#### Nothing, we're perfect
Note:
- Or maybe this bgr.image
- And please no libgdx
- Although probably not write a single semicolon more than needed
    - Build-server, could as well be fictive
        - Static code analysis
        - Automatic testing
        - Continuous "deployment"
    - Professional code standard analysis, could also be fictive
    - Professional vulnerability tool, also could be fictive
    - Functional JAR working on most OS-es? a complete waste of time

Note:
- Fix bugs
- Make our tools happy again
- Fix rushed code
    - Like the 75 lines long "compareTo()" in damageToken
